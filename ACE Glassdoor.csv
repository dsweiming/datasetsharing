Ignores global best practices in IT such as PMP, ITIL, TOGAF, etc... Only ideas from the top gets executed. IT leaders are not visionary in IT and do not have strong IT background to drive the IT organization to be world class. Employees are just robot followers and doers. It's like blind leading the blind. New experienced employees are not welcomed to share their past experiences as management and existing colleagues feels they themselves know much better from many years working in their cocoon. Employees are not encouraged to give ideas or solutions to a problem as those who do will be blamed later when things go wrong. Everybody tries to keep their mouth shut although they have the solution fear of being blamed or bosses unhappy for someone being too outspoken. Only those senior employees who are influential who worked long enough in the company get to be heard, or employees whose level is the head of departments. Turnover rate is very high, at least 2 resignations every quarter."
